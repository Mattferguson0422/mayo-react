					nurses.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Location</strong>: East Tower 4A/B (ET4A/B), Heart Rhythm and
				Interventional Services<br /><br /><strong>Patient Care Type</strong>: This is a medical cardiovascular
					interventional monitored unit. The majority of the patient population consists of patients
					undergoing procedures for known cardiac disease or disorders including: PCI/stent, valvuloplasty,
					ablations, temporary or permanent pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, PFO closures, and atrial
					septal defect repair who do not require the ICU setting. Other procedural patients may come to
					ET4A/B as well, including carotid or peripheral artery stenting. These patients are medically
					managed by interventional and inpatient cardiology services as directed by the Cardiac Lab and Heart
					Rhythm physicians. Their length of stay is approximately 24-48 hours with high acuity the first 12
					hours post- procedure. In addition, ET4A/B cares for other cardiovascular medical admit patients.
					Patients initiated and maintained on IV medication therapy (epoprostenol/Treprostinil)for pulmonary
					hypertension will be assigned to ET4A/B.<br /><br /><strong>Bed #</strong>: 24<br /><br /><strong>For new
						grad nurses</strong>: All newly graduated Registered Nurses with less than 12 months of practice
						experience, hired into a scheduled FTE Registered Nurse position on the Rochester campus of Mayo

							target="_blank">Nurse Residency Program</a>. A separate application or enrollment process is

							of the RN. The RN provides leadership through activities such as preceptor role, informal
							leadership roles, and quality improvement efforts. The RN delegates patient care according
							to skill level, experience, patient acuity, fiscal accountability, and adequacy of
							resources. The RN possesses excellent communication skills; is skillful in mentoring and
							teaching; and may participate on committees or projects. A subset of employees may be
							required to drive their personal vehicle as a part of the responsibility of their role.
